            Removing Expiration Notices from Internet-Drafts
               draft-thomson-gendispatch-no-expiry-latest

Abstract

   The long-standing policy of requiring that Internet-Drafts bear an
   expiration date is no longer necessary.  This document removes
   requirements for expiration for Internet-Drafts from RFC 2026/BCP 9
   and RFC 2418/BCP 25.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at https://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   This Internet-Draft will expire on 24 May 2020.

1.  Introduction

   The I-D Guidelines (https://www.ietf.org/standards/ids/guidelines/)
   declares that Internet-Drafts expire 185 days after their posting
   unless replaced or under a range of special conditions, such as when
   the document is under IESG review.

   Expiration of drafts is believed to encourage authors to update
   drafts that they wish to discuss.  Expired drafts are no longer
   served from the primary IETF servers.

   Copies of expired drafts are retained and can be obtained using other
   services.  Expired drafts are routinely cited and referenced.
   Published RFCs routinely include informative references to drafts,
   which then usually expire.

   Forced expiration serves no purpose that is not adequately served by
   the publication date on the document.

2.  Removing Internet-Draft Expiration

   The date of posting for an Internet-Draft is sufficient information
   for readers to understand validity.

Internet-Draft             Drafts Aren't Milk              November 2019


   This document proposes that the "Expires:" field be removed from the
   header of submitted Internet-Drafts, and that the boilerplate be
   amended as follows:

   OLD:

      Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
      months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other
      documents at any time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts
      as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in
      progress."

   NEW:

      Internet-Drafts are draft documents that may be updated, replaced,
      or obsoleted by other documents at any time.  It is inappropriate
      to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them other
      than as "work in progress."

   Creating a revision to the I-D Guidelines will be necessary to remove
   references to expiration.

   This document updates RFC 2026 [STD] to remove the second paragraph
   of Section 2.2 and RFC 2418 [WG] to remove a single mention of
   expiration from Section 7.2.

   Other than these specific changes, both RFC 2026 and RFC 2418 refer
   to expiration of drafts.  With this change, this is understood to
   apply to drafts that are marked as "dead" in tooling.

3.  Replacement Procedures

   The expiration of a draft is intended to ensure that the topic is
   disqualified from consideration and discussion.  At the same time,
   updating a draft indicates continued interest from the authors.

   Working Groups chairs might choose to concentrate efforts on drafts
   that have been recently updated.  For instance, when setting an
   agenda for a session, chairs might give precedence to documents that
   have been updated since the preceding session.

   Expiration has also been used as a reminder to authors to update
   documents.  A substitute for expiration reminders might be to provide
   a note in advance of planned sessions.
